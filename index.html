    <p>When people land on your website, they want to know who you are, what you do, and whether you have the skills and qualities to work at their company. <br> Sharing your life story isn't the primary objective of your bio, <br> but rather showing visitors how you can help them; either by working with them one on one or by joining their ranks.

        Most people use their About page to share a brief biography. <br> This is the place to share the most important details that are relevant to your professional life:</p>
    <p>You can also include a brief section about what matters most to you,<br> what causes you believe in, and a few hobbies to make it <br> more engaging and to show off your personality.</p>
